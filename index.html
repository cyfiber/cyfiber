	<h2>Current Project: LEFT UNSAID</h2> 
	<p> Dear my QTPOC, NYC native, brown gyals and bois, 
		My name is Cy-Fi, and this is my invitation to y'all. I've created a series of 4D works, that address the countless micro and macroaggressions that we are faced with on a daily basis and asked to accept as a lifestyle. These are multi-faceted pieces, layered with my own experience. I am hoping to create an archive where these kinds of works can live and serve as an archive for youth and future generations of lost filmmakers, artists, creatives, students, and people can appreciate and learn that there is a place for them. If you want to submit please click the link below. I want this to expand so far that it wont even be important who started this, but will be important how many of us there are.
